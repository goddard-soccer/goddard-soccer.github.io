The Goddard Soccer League was founded with the sole purpose of providing soccer players of all skill levels with a fun and inviting environment. The league is open to all Goddard employees and their family members as well as the occasional guest players. Each team is rich with history, some dating back to the 1970â€™s. While the Gold and Blue teams enjoyed early success, the Grey and Green teams have made a name for themselves the past decade. Join a team and become a part of the Goddard League experience.
