**Q:** What if I signed up without a team preference but I don't see myself on the rosters page?<br>
**A:** If the season hasn't started yet, relax, the exec. board is likely discussing roster changes, if necessary. If the season has started, message an exec. board member via Microsoft Teams (preferably Tyler Lee at the moment), and we will get you on a team. You are also welcome to just come to the next game and we will get you playing.

**Q:** How do I contact my team?<br>
**A:** We generally leave this up to team captains, but typically each team has a GroupMe, Microsoft Team, or other forum of communication which they should be adding you to. If you are unable to message your captain, please message the global soccer <strong class="text-rainbow">[teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ag6UYrqOstWyW6S9Q-_jaSfmMqjkvoZauibWuiVI-HcY1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=5a25d439-e73f-44bf-9232-5bc6fd755435&tenantId=7005d458-45be-48ae-8140-d43da96dd17b)</strong> or failing that, an exec. board member. (See About page for exec. members)

**Q:** Where are the games played?<br>
**A:** Games will take place at the Goddard soccer field behind the B11 parking lot, just look for the sign!

**Q:** How long are the games?<br>
**A:** Each game consists of two 35-minute halves with a 5-minute half-time in between periods. 

**Q:** Who can join the league?<br>
**A:** GSL is operated under Goddard's Employee Welfare Association (GEWA) and is open to all badged Goddard employees. The league is co-ed and is open to players **of all skill levels!** We welcome and encourage everyone interested in the sport of soccer to participate. 

**Q:** Can I bring a guest?<br>
**A:** Yes! We are permitting one guest per badged employee.

**Q:** How do I get my guest in?<br>
**A:** Look at the Goddard Sports Soccer Teams page for step by step instructions.

**Q:** I don't have Venmo to pay league fees, can I still participate?<br>
**A:** Yes, however, we strongly prefer league fee payments via Venmo. If you do not have Venmo, please coordinate with another league member to Venmo on your behalf, and put their name down on the sign up instead of your Venmo ID.

**Q:** I can't make every scheduled game, can I still participate?<br>
**A:** Yes! We understand that players may not be able to attend every game. Once placed on a team, please coordinate with the associated Team Captain to inform them of your availability. (Typically they'll poll each week with who is coming...)

**Q:** Does GSL hold weekly pick-up games?<br>
**A:** GSL only holds weekly pick-up games outside of active league seasons when daylight and weather permit. Weekly pickup games begin at 5PM and are held on the Main Lawn in between Buildings 1 and 3/14. For more information on pickup games, please join our <strong class="text-rainbow">[teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ag6UYrqOstWyW6S9Q-_jaSfmMqjkvoZauibWuiVI-HcY1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=5a25d439-e73f-44bf-9232-5bc6fd755435&tenantId=7005d458-45be-48ae-8140-d43da96dd17b)</strong>!

**Q:** What are the GSL rules?<br>
**A:** Great question, hope you aren't in the middle of an argument :D. The rules can be found <strong class="text-rainbow">[here](/assets/docs/rules.pdf)</strong>

**Q:** Is Brandon Burkholder literally the worst thing that has happened, is happening, or will ever happen to humanity?<br>
**A:** Definitely. As scientists we are normally far from certain, even math has been proven incomplete, but in this regard it is beyond the scope of our perceived reality or any other reality, dimensioned or non-dimensioned.
