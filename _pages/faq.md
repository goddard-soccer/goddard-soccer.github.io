**Q:** What if I signed up without a team preference but I don't see myself on the rosters page?<br>
**A:** If the season hasn't started yet, relax, the exec. board is likely discussing roster changes, if necessary. If the season has started, message an exec. board member (preferably Tyler Lee at the moment), and we will get you on a team. You are also welcome to just come to the next game and we will get you playing.

**Q:** How long are the games?<br>
**A:** Each game consists of two 35-minute halves with a 5-minute half-time in between periods. 

**Q:** Who can join the league?<br>
**A:** GSL is operated under Goddard's Employee Welfare Association (GEWA) and is open to all badged Goddard employees. The league is co-ed and is open to players of all skill levels! We welcome and encourage everyone interested in the sport of soccer to participate. 

**Q:** Can I bring a guest?<br>
**A:** Yes! We are permitting one guest per badged employee.

**Q:** How do I get my guest in?<br>
**A:** Look at the Goddard Sports Soccer Teams page for step by step instructions.

**Q:** I don't have Venmo to pay league fees, can I still participate?<br>
**A:** Yes, however, we strongly prefer league fee payments via Venmo. If you do not have Venmo, please email nasagoddardsoccer@gmail.com for alternative payment options. 

**Q:** I can't make every scheduled game, can I still participate?<br>
**A:** Yes! We understand that players may not be able to attend every game. Once placed on a team, please coordinate with the associated Team Captain to inform them of your availability.  

**Q:** Does GSL hold weekly pick-up games?<br>
**A:** GSL only holds weekly pick-up games outside of active league seasons when daylight and weather permit. Weekly pickup games begin at 5PM and are held on the Main Lawn in between Buildings 1 and 3/14.

**Q:** Is Brandon Burkholder literally the worst thing that has happened, is happening, or will ever happen to humanity?<br>
**A:** Definitely. As scientists we are normally far from certain, even math has been proven incomplete, but in this regard it is beyond the scope of our perceived reality or any other reality, dimensioned or non-dimensioned.
